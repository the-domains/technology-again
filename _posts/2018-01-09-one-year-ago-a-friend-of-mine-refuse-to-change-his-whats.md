# One year ago.. .

A friend of mine refuse to change his WhatsApp display photo. He says it's " impossible" to get back.

After explaining , he was not conveince. I demostrated and within 15 minutes. A full resolution photo which I gain access and send it to him. Of course I end there . Hint2\.

Those who knows me better knows I DISLIKE WhatsApp chatting and sharing personal information, taking photo of sensitive documents

Some may argue , but WhatsApp is encrypted. Haha. Strong True encryption are hardware base not software made. But is is possible software encryption are as good..not in WhatsApp thou

After leaving my old workforce. I was surprise to know the IT team swicth to WhatsApp as main mode to comms out.

Snapping photo sharing senstive info and more

This lead me to discuss with another friend which which "i" demo the possibility of gaining the entire WhatsApp log without "i' in the group chat.

A friend who has a degree in cyber forensic from the same organization did. Not even take action. Sad.

I mean no harm.thus I constant reminder my closer friends. Use another App. It's paid..it's truly safe. Encrypt PGP style.

Fast forward..here is the full news
