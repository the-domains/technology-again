> \>\> Unauthenticated LAN remote code execution in AsusWRT
> \>\> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security
> =================================================================================
> Disclosure: 22/01/2018 / Last updated: 25/01/2018
> \>\> Background and summary
> AsusWRT is the operating system used in mid range and high end Asus routers. It is based on Linux, but with a sleek web UI and a slimmed down profile suitable for running on resource constrained routers.
> Thankfully ASUS is a responsible company, and not only they publish the full source code as required by the GPL, but they also give users full root access to their router via SSH. Overall the security of their operating system is pretty good, especially when compared to other router manufacturers.
> However due to a number of coding errors, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN to achieve remote code execution in the router as the root user.
> A special thanks to Beyond Security SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure (SSD) programme for disclosing these vulnerabilities to the manufacturer, speeding the resolution of the issues discovered (see \[1\] for their advisory).
> \>\> Technical details:
> \#1
> Vulnerability: HTTP server authentication bypass
> CVE-2018-5999
> Attack Vector: Remote
> Constraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
> Affected versions: confirmed on v3.0.0.4.380.7743; possibly affects every version before v3.0.0.4.384.10007
> The AsusWRT HTTP server has a flaw in handle\_request() that allows an unauthenticated user to perform a POST request for certain actions.
> In AsusWRT\_source/router/httpd/httpd.c:
> handle\_request(void)
> {
> ...
> handler-\>auth(auth\_userid, auth\_passwd, auth\_realm);
> auth\_result = auth\_check(auth\_realm, authorization, url, file, cookies, fromapp);
> if (auth\_result != 0) input) {
> handler-\>input(file, conn\_fp, cl, boundary); \> Fix:
> Upgrade to AsusWRT v3.0.0.4.384.10007 or above.
> See \[4\] for the very few details and new firmware released by Asus.
