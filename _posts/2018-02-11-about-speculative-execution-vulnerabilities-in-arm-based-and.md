<article style=""><h1>Cisco Security Advisory: CPU Side-Channel Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities</h1><p>On January 3, 2018, researchers disclosed three vulnerabilities that take advantage of the implementation of speculative execution of instructions on many modern microprocessor architectures to perform side-channel information disclosure attacks. These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes or memory allocated to the operating system kernel.</p></article>
